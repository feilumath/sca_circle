Probabilistic cellular automata on a cyclic graph with a finite alphabet, and each site makes a random move independently according to a distribution determined by its neighorhood's empirical distribuiton multiplied by a local transition matrix. The process is a finite state Markov chain. 
- run_infer_predict_synchr.m shows the synchronization. 
- run_special_examples.m shows the dynamics/estimation for a few special examples.
- test_convergence.m shows the convergence of LSE-traj and LSE-ensemble.
- prob_transit_matrix.m shows the dependence of the global tansition matrix on the local transition matrix.
